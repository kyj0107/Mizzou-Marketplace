Hello!

This is the makings of a Mizzou Marketplace website!

Currently, it's a work in progress, but we've got some basic Flask stuff set up!

10/21/2024 Update:

I've got a Docker environment up and running! Navigate to mu_marketplace_env and run docker compose up -d to install the MySQL container. I haven't gotten around to getting it to work with the Flask app yet, but feel free to play around with the database.
